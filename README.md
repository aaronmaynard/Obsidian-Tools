A Minecraft mod that extends the capabilities of the tool crafting system.  In the vanilla game you have the ability to craft things out of pretty much anything.  Unfortunatly when you spend too much time in the game like I have, you start wishing you were able to do more.  This helps with one of those issues.



Create new tools such as:

+ Obsidian Pickaxe
+ Obsidian Shovel
+ Obsidian Axe
+ Obsidian Hoe
+ Obsidian Sword

The crafting recipies for these items are the same for any other of the corresponding tool, and the durability / efficiency scales accordingly as well.  If you don't want to go through the effort of obtaining this precious recourse, you can always change to creative mode or use the consol.

```
/give [player] obsidiantools:obsidianpickaxe [number]
/give [player] obsidiantools:obsidianshovel [number]
/give [player] obsidiantools:obsidianaxe [number]
/give [player] obsidiantools:obsidianhoe [number]
/give [player] obsidiantools:obsidiansword [number]
```

Once you obtain these new craftable tools, you will also unlock the following acheivement:
